# Breast-Cancer-Classification

Breast cancer (BC) is one of the most common cancers among women worldwide, representingthe majority of new cancer cases and cancer-related deaths according to global statistics, making it a significant public health problem in todayâ€™s society. The early diagnosis of BC can improve the prognosis and chance of survival significantly, as it can promote timely clinical treatment to patients. Further accurate classification of benign tumors can prevent patients undergoing unnecessary treatments. Thus, the correct diagnosis of
BC and classification of patients into malignant or benign groups is the subject of much research. Because of its unique advantages in critical features detection from complex BC datasets, machine learning (ML) is widely recognized as the methodology of choice in BC pattern classification and forecast modelling.

We will use Breast Cancer Classification Dataset available at UCI Machine Learning Repository:
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/breast+cancer+wisconsin+%28diagnostic%29

Dataset Information:
Features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image.
Number of Instances: 569
Class Distribution: 212 Malignant, 357 Benign
Number of Features: 30
Number of Output Classes: 02

Extracted Set of Features:
Thirty real-valued features are computed for each cell nucleus: Examples include:
a) radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)
b) texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)
c) perimeter
d) area
e) smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)
f) compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0)
g) concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)
h) concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)
i) symmetry
j) fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1)
